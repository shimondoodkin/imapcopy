IMAP Copy
=========

A simple utility to copy folders between IMAP mail servers.

It only requires standard Python 3.5 or later. 
For windows 7 probably need Python 3.7

Examples
--------

Assume you have, for example, a Gmail account and want to copy its folders to ``otherserver``.
You can use the IMAP protocol on both servers, **provided IMAP access is enabled on Gmail**.
Generally, you can copy folders and their contents between any two IMAP-enabled email servers.

Testing the connection and credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before actually copying messages, test the IMAP connection and credentials to both the source
server and your ``otherserver``; if the connection succeeds, IMAP folder names found on both servers
will be listed:

::

    python3 imapcopy.py \
      --test \
      "imap.googlemail.com:993"     "username@gmail.com:password" \
      "imap.otherserver.com.au:993" "username:password"

Useful url:
--------
- https://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha if you login with password
- https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords might work, probably requires 2-step verification set to ON 


XOAUTH support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
to login to gmail with oauth, the password should be equal to 'xoauth'
::

    python3 imapcopy.py \
      --test \
      "imap.googlemail.com:993"     "username@gmail.com:xoauth" \
      "imap.otherserver.com.au:993" "username:not supported"

My credencial probably wont work for you. So you need to get your own, and edit the code to add them.

I got the client_id and client_secret from:

- In google console https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - need to create a project (in drop down select box on top bar near logo)
- In that app, in project's menu (on side) in Credentials https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - need to create a client id (in button ' + CREATE CREDENCIALS ' select 'Oauth Client ID', application type is desktop application), fill in the given values in the code.
- To be able to use oauth consent screen, In project's menu (on side) in OAuth consent screen https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
   - select User type to be External, and create an app.
   - Edit App ( fill in app name and User support email, Developer contact information, do not fill App domain links or add Authorized domains, click save and continue.  click ' ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES ', then type in the Manually add scopes text box the scope 'https://mail.google.com/' and click add to table. )
   - in Test users, add your emails to be able to use them as consent screen users.


Copying messages from folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
To copy all the messages from, say, the ``INBOX`` folder of Gmail to the ``Inbox`` folder
of your ``otherserver``:

::

    python3 imapcopy.py \
      --verbose \
      "imap.googlemail.com:993"     "username@gmail.com:password" \
      "imap.otherserver.com.au:993" "username:password" \
      "INBOX" "Inbox"

You can provide many folders to copy; alternating between source and destination.
For example, to copy from ``INBOX`` to ``Inbox`` and from ``[Gmail]/Sent Mail``
to ``Sent``:

::

    python3 imapcopy.py \
      --verbose \
      "imap.googlemail.com:993"     "username@gmail.com:password" \
      "imap.otherserver.com.au:993" "username:password" \
      "INBOX"              "Inbox" \
      "[Gmail]/Sent Mail"  "Sent"

Copying a range of messages from a folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Gmail throttles uploading and downloading email messages over IMAP, you 
may find the ``--skip`` and ``--limit`` options handy. For instance, If Gmail
disconnects you after copying 123 email messages out of your total 1000
messages in the example shown above, you may use the following command to
resume copying skipping the first 123 messages:

::

    python3 imapcopy.py \
      â€“-skip 123 \
      "imap.googlemail.com:993"     "username@gmail.com:password" \
      "imap.otherserver.com.au:993" "username:password" \
      "INBOX" "Inbox"

Similarly, the ``--limit`` option allows you to copy only at most ``N`` messages
excluding the skipped messages. For example, the following command will copy
messages number 124 through 223 from Gmail:

::

    python3 imapcopy.py \
       --skip 123 --limit 100 \
      "imap.googlemail.com:993"     "username@gmail.com:password" \
      "imap.otherserver.com.au:993" "username:password" \
      "INBOX" "Inbox"

Copying all folders and sub-folders from a server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``--recurse`` option copies the contents of a folder and its sub-folders.
Also, if you use an empty string ``""`` as the source ``folder``, all the folders in
the source server  will be copied to the destination.

:: 

    python3 imapcopy.py \
      --recurse \
      "imap.googlemail.com:993"     "username@gmail.com:password" \
      "imap.otherserver.com.au:993" "username:password" \
      ""   "Imported"
